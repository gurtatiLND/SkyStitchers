# Skystitchers

A response to the Code First Girls WebDev Challenge - build a website from scratch in two weeks. 
<br>

Our team created an educational website for children aged 7 - 12 to learn sewing and crafts.
<br>

We built a responsive web page with HTML, CSS and JS, selecting inclusive colour palettes, curating content in an accessible way and using semantic tags.
