                            <p class="review1">The teacher was knowledgeable and patient, and I learned so much in the short period of time. The class was very well organized and the class materials were provided in an easy to follow manner.

                        <p class="review2">The teacher was friendly and knowledgeable, making sure that each student received individual attention and guidance. My daughter particularly enjoyed learning the basics of how to thread a needle, how to sew different kinds of stitches, and how to complete a small sewing project. She was proud of what she had accomplished and is now eager to attend the next classes!

                        <p class="review3">My daughter learned a variety of techniques, from threading needles to creating basic stitches and seam finishes. The instructor was extremely patient and encouraging, and even allowed the students to design their own projects. My daughter is now proud to show off her amazing creations and has even offered to teach me a few skills! If your kids are interested in learning how to sew, this is the perfect class to get them started.
