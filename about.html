                    <h2>Skystitchers' Story</h2>
                    <p>We are five women with a passion for coding and a love for textiles came together to form the SkyStitchers team. We are participants in the Code First Girl MOOC Challenge and we had the idea to create a website that would bring the world of textiles to life for kids and their parents. </p>
                    <p>The website filled with tutorials, tips, and tricks for kids and anyone looking to get started with textiles. Soon there will be more lessons on weaving, embroidery, knitting, and so much more. The tutorials were designed to be easy to follow and included step-by-step instructions with clear illustrations and videos.</p>
