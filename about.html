                    <h2>Skystitchers' Story</h2>
                    <p>This website was crafted by a group of women who have a shared passion for both coding and textiles. Our collaboration, known as the SkyStitchers team, was born out of our participation in the Code First Girl Web Development Challenge. This experience inspired us to conceive a website that aims to introduce the world of textiles to children and their parents in an engaging and interactive manner.</p>
                    <p>The website filled with tutorials, tips, and tricks for kids and anyone looking to get started with textiles. Soon there will be more lessons on weaving, embroidery, knitting, and so much more. The tutorials were designed to be easy to follow and included step-by-step instructions with clear illustrations and videos.</p>
